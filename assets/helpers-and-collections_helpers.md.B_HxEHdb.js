We also talked a bit about Laravel’s collections, or arrays on steroids, in <a href="./../databases-and-eloquent/configuration.html">Database and Eloquent</a>.</p><p>In this chapter we’ll cover some of the more common and powerful helpers and some of the basics of programming with collections. Many of the “helpers” in this section that once were global functions are now calls on facades; array_first(), the global function, has been replaced by Arr::first(), the auth call. So while these aren’t all technically helpers, as they’re not all global functions anymore, they still have the same position in our toolbox.</p><h2 id="ayudantes" tabindex="-1">Ayudantes <a class="header-anchor" href="#ayudantes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Ayudantes&quot;">​</a></h2>',4),l=[n];function r(c,i,h,d,p,u){return t(),a("div",null,l)}const m=e(s,[["render",r]]);export{_ as __pageData,m as default};
