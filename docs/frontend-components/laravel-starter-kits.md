# Componentes del Frontend

Laravel is mainly known as a PHP framework, but itâ€™s also full stack, meaning it has a
series of components and conventions focused on generating frontend code. Some of
these, like pagination and message bags, are PHP helpers that target the frontend, but
Laravel also provides a Vite-based frontend build system, some conventions around
non-PHP assets, and several starter kits.
