# Configuración

The core settings of your Laravel application— database connection settings, queue
and mail settings, etc.—live in files in the config folder. Each of these files returns a
PHP array, and each value in the array is accessible by a config key that is comprised
of the filename and all descendant keys, separated by dots (.).
